I am the Founder of [Technecultura](https://www.technecultura.org), centering my research and advocacy on AI governance and safety for the Global Majority. I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, where my research leveraged ethnographic methods to understand how frontline healthcare workers in rural India perceive and value AI and analyzed how AI explainability can meet the needs of novice technology users in the Global Majority. My work has been published at top-tier venues in HCI and sociotechnical computing, including the Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) CHI, CSCW, COMPASS, EAAMO, and FAccT conferences. I am an AI & Emerging Technologies Policy Specialist at the United Nations, a former Fellow at the Brookings Institution and have worked in research-based roles at Apple and Microsoft. I have also been recognized as one of the [world’s most influential people in AI](https://time.com/7012894/chinasa-t-okolo/) by TIME Magazine, honored in the inaugural [Forbes 30 Under 30 AI](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2025/ai) list, named one of the [Most Influential Africans of 2024](https://100.newafricanmagazine.com/) by New African Magazine, a [Trailblazer in Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers/Fellows), and one of [100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics™](https://womeninaiethics.org/the-list/of-2022/).

My research examines how African governments can effectuate robust AI and data governance, investigates the geopolitical impacts of AI, and analyzes datafication and algorithmic marginalization in Africa. My general research interests include AI governance, AI safety, AI literacy, explainable AI, and African development. My work has been supported by the Social Science Research Council, MacArthur Foundation, McGovern Foundation, Kapor Center, The National GEM Consortium, Oracle Corporation, the North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and Google and covered in venues like _VICE, Bloomberg, Newsweek, The Washington Post_, and _VentureBeat_, amongst others. I have been invited to share my work at industry research labs, including Google Research India, Microsoft Research India, and the Microsoft Africa Research Institute (MARI). I have also been featured in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/24/women-in-ai-chinasa-t-okolo-researches-ais-impact-on-the-global-south/) and provided commentary to leading outlets such as _MIT Technology Review, NPR, the New York Times, BBC, VICE, Scientific American, Fast Company, Voice of America, Rest of World_, _SEMAFOR_, and _Devex_.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Pomona College, a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Cornell University, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University. I have also served as a consulting + drafting Member for the African Union Continental AI Strategy, an expert contributing writer to the International AI Safety Report, a drafting member of the Nigerian Federal Government National AI Strategy, the Editor-in-Chief of ACM SIGCAS _Computers and Society_, a member of the IEEE Standards Association working group on algorithmic bias, and a contributing member of the ACM US Technology Policy Committee.

I’m open to media requests, invited talks, panels, consulting projects, invitations to advisory boards/committees, and other relevant opportunities. For inquiries, please refer to the guidance listed in my [Media Kit](https://github.com/chinasatokolo/MediaKit).
