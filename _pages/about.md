I am a Fellow in the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution and a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. At Cornell, my research leveraged ethnographic methods to understand how frontline healthcare workers in rural India perceive and value AI and analyzed how AI explainability can meet the needs of novice technology users in the Global South.

My research interests include AI governance & policy, AI literacy, human-centered AI, explainable AI, data economies, African development, and global health. My work has been supported by The National GEM Consortium, Oracle Corporation, NANOG, Google, and the NSF and covered in venues like VICE, Bloomberg, Newsweek, and VentureBeat, amongst others.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Pomona College, a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Cornell University, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University. Aside from my work at Brookings, I also serve as a Consulting Expert with the African Union, an Ethics Advisor to the Equiano Institute, a member of the IEEE Standards Association working group on algorithmic bias, and a contributing member of the ACM US Technology Policy Committee.

I’m open to media requests, invited talks, panels, consulting projects, invitations to advisory boards/committees, and other relevant opportunities.
